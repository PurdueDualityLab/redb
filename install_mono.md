When installing wine in a headless environment, run the following command:

```bash
$ wine msiexec /i <msi file>
```

This is particularly useful when installing mono-complete. I recommend installing
the wine-complete msi from [here](https://dl.winehq.org/wine/wine-mono/7.1.1/wine-mono-7.1.1.msi).
Then, run the above command.
